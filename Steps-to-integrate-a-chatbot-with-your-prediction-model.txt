Steps to integrate a Chatbot with your prediction model:
---------------------------------------------------------

1. Built encoders and decoders while predicting hindi text from english input
2. Loaded these encoders, decoders, tokenizers and generated padded sequences in a python module. This module also contains the prediction
(decode_sentence) function.
3. Saved this as a module.
4. Loaded this module which loaded the model corresponding to Step 2. 
5. Used Flask to associate a web service to this model.
6. In Slack, I created a team space. 
7. I went to slack app api link, I created a slack app - eng-to-hindi-translation.
8. But to communicate with my model, the app needed a public url. Slash command will be used to trigger the communication between slack
and your web service. 
9. I downloaded ngrok software to map a public url to the flask web service that I started in Step 5.
10. In the slash command, I have given the forwarding url (public url) details.
11. In Slack team space,I called the model using the slash command (/engtohindi) and it returned the hindi text to me.
